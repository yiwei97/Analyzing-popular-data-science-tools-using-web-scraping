Have you ever wanted to build customer-facing products that rely extensively on data insights and models? Have you ever been keen on building a recommender model to customise your Grab app (or any other consumer app) experience? If you answered yes to either of these questions .. then look no further!

The Analytics team mission is to use data and experimentation to advance product innovation. We love building hacky products to test and iterate what’s best for our customers. As we ship multiple products every week, it means we have to fine-tune models, run and evaluate hundreds of experiments weekly! We are looking for junior and experienced data scientists to build a center of data excellence for Product & Experimentation in a diverse range of tech families. Your role is to guide a data-first approach to product thinking, design controlled experiments and be objective while evaluating results, all of this while working with stakeholders to evaluate new and innovative product and business ideas! You will help developers, designers & product managers across the company with recommendations on how to learn from unexpected results, study underlying causes for them and iterate on the next set of products to build for our users.

What Will You Do?

You will be working closely with various teams within a business line (Product, Business, Engineering, Design and Data Science) to understand data requirements, identify and track key metrics, and provide data-driven insights. You will also work with stakeholders to evaluate the feasibility of new business/product ideas and provide appropriate recommendations.

A Day In The Life

Understand business objectives and deepdive into existing data to recommend new product ideas to solve for the most impactful customer problems (pssh .. some top-secret products await you!)
Use data to identify trends, spot anomalies and deepdive into their root causes
Use your number-crunching and slide-maker skills to use and present data beyond just numbers. Hone your data storytelling skills through visualisation techniques by building dashboards and presenting insights to a non-technical audience!
Evaluate the feasibility of developing new products, participate in user researches to validate customer problems
Align with stakeholders on key product metrics, design and propose experimentation strategies.
Launch A/B tests, analyze experiment results and provide recommendations
Design and own frontend and backend data specs for new products, while collaborating with engineering teams to ensure accurate and timely data collection
Develop and maintain data pipelines to fulfill product reporting requirements

The Must Haves

A curious and confident soul (with a dash of humour) who loves using data!
For Data Scientists, some relevant experience and for Senior Data Scientists, 2-3+ years relevant industry experience (preferably in an Internet or ‘Direct to Consumer’ company with high velocity data and scaled controlled experiments). Prior experience with Product Management will be a definite plus.
Strong statistical knowledge - ideally having utilized controlled experiments in the industry.
You enjoy using SQL, Google Sheets, R, SQL and other scripting/programming languages to solve customer-problems. Experience in Spark (Scala / pySpark) would be a plus.

Trade Operations Engineer – Quant Trading,Saragossa,"Singapore, Singapore",Hybrid,4 days ago,9 applicants,Full-time · Associate,"10,001+ employees",IT Services and IT Consulting,"About the job
Support and handle the production environment at a world class trading firm who are always looking to improve.

You’re going to be coming into the Singapore office, focusing on risk management and the day-to-day of the trading platforms. This is a hands-on, high impact and high-performance position where you’ll see instant results from what you do. There’s a strong culture here of rewarding for the work everyone does – if your work produces high impact, it’ll have a high impact on your bonus.

Let’s not hide from the fact when you mention “high impact” and “high-performance”, it can be a high-pressure position – it’s not the right environment for everyone – but this position requires a very low error rate and the ability to get to grips with their trading system as quickly as possible. Automating and optimising as much as possible will decrease this error rate, so you’ll need to be able to spot areas for improvement and bring your ideas to the table.

One of the great things about the culture is that your ideas will be listened to, and you’ll be given the resources to deliver them.

The trading platforms are built using C++ and Java, all on Linux. You don’t need to be at developer level for this, but you’ll need to have experience reading and fixing bugs in the code, with Java being the preferred language.

You’ll also need to have a strong interest or experience in quantitative trading and have a strong understanding of how you’ll support these platforms, therefore you’ll need to have experience supporting some form of financial trading platform.

Technology is at the heart of the business and it drives change and improvements across all aspects of everyone’s job here. You’ll be compensated extremely well – with salaries and bonuses expected to be at the top end of the Singapore market. We’re happy to discuss this in detail with you on application, but there’s no specific range given for this role as it’ll be based on your requirements.

This is a fully office based position, but you will have your food provided for you for free every day. Other benefits include pension and comprehensive medical coverage.

Ready to take control of and improve trading operations here? Get in touch.

Why Cisco

WE ARE CISCO

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns, and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool."

Undertake these responsibilities in the project:

Task 1: Data analytics and machine learning for ship route optimization

Based on the vessels route and weather data, an optimization technique will be employed to suggest an optimal route for shuttle bunkering in Singapore sea. The developed code will take into consideration the vessel velocity, wave and current condition, wind loading and seabed bathymetry in suggesting the optimal vessel route in order to achieve fuel and operational efficiency. the multi-objectives optimization scheme will be utilized in the project to meet the objective functions based on the variables given.

Task 2: Data analytics and machine learning for achieving ship fuel efficiency

The big data analytics and machine learning system will be utilized to predict the fuel consumption of harbor craft vessels based on the weather data and actual ship fuel consumption collected from the mass flowmeter. The task involves considering various machine learning technique or devising new innovative ML technique to accurately predict the fuel consumption of the vessel. This shall aid the ship operators in planning the shipping route that could optimize the fuel consumption, and as a result play an important in mitigating carbon emission.

Task 3: Business Model, Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making Framework

In this task a multiple-criteria framework for the selection of suitable energy conversion systems (including prime mover) on the basis of pertinent cost, environmental and safety considerations will be developed. It is important to highlight that the decision-making model to be developed will take account of the whole life-cycle of the ship (design & construction, operation, disposal). Comparisons of ship performance will be made for different ship energy systems layouts and configurations considered (for example diesel, as compared to diesel-batteries, diesel-electric, LNG-fuelled, etc.). Modern approaches for multiple-criteria decision-making will be reviewed for implementation, with a focus on overcoming shortcomings, in particular the fact that the criteria to be taken into account are usually expressed in different metrics (for example, cost of a prime mover in monetary units vs. emissions expressed as CO2 kilograms emitted). The key processes in this research are to convert all incomparable values into monetary values, thereby enabling the impacts of each criterion to be compared and integrated in a straightforward manner. The multiple-criteria framework will be applied in a number of case studies for the selected ship, examining its applicability for alternative scenarios.
